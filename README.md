# 🚀 Harsh's Developer Portfolio

> "I don't just build web apps — I build momentum."

Welcome to my little corner of the internet — a full-stack-powered, pixel-polished, personality-packed portfolio made to showcase not just *what* I’ve built, but *how* I think.

🛠️ Built with:
- ⚛️ [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) — for blazing-fast SSR magic
- 🎨 [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) — for atomic styling that doesn’t slow me down
- 💡 Framer Motion — because static is boring
- 💌 EmailJS / API endpoint — so you can *actually* talk to me
- ✨ tsParticles — because why not have animated `{}` flying around?

## ✨ What you'll find here

📌 **Hero**  
A cinematic entrance. Animated background. Statement of purpose.

📌 **Timeline**  
Not just jobs — a story. Clean code to product vision, freelancing chaos to startup clarity.

📌 **Expertise Section**  
Not “Skills” — but systems I’ve tamed:  
ERP? ✅  
E-commerce? ✅  
Real-time chat? ✅  
Education tech? ✅

📌 **Contact Section**  
Drop a message. It’s validated, animated, and lands straight in my inbox. No ghosting, promise.

📌 **Resume Preview**  
No forced downloads. Just one sleek PDF modal pop-up away.

## 🧠 Why I built this

Because resumes don’t show the *how*.  
Because LinkedIn is too... LinkedIn.  
Because I wanted a space that reflects the dev I am —  
pragmatic, creative, and just a little over-caffeinated ☕
